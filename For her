  <h1>To the cutest notification I get,</h1>

  <p>I hope you're doing pretty fine after all this shifting to a new place and all — that's a sudden change, I know, and also literally near your birthday. <span class="highlight">THAT SUCKS!</span></p>
  <p>But my advice? Chill. It's kinda hard but yup, you’ve gotta do that.</p>
  <p>You know when we met on that shitty website? It was <strong>17th of June 2024</strong>.</p>
  <p>Yup, I didn't remember either. Had to go through the diary I used to blabber about a lot.</p>
  <p>It’s kind of funny how someone can start as just a name on a screen and slowly become someone you genuinely care about. We haven’t known each other forever, but what we’ve had so far has been fun, unexpected, and honestly something I look forward to.</p>

  <p>I can't be there in person (deadly-sadly). No IRL surprises, nor cakes, no ghummi-ghummi, no flowers, no hugs, nor anything. So I came up with this. A small surprise like this can make you smile. AND I WAS RIGHT. LIKE HELL — LOOK AT YOUUU BUAHHAHAHAHA!</p>

  <p>But ahh that hurts. I wish I could be there — like really. I’ll come someday for sure. And Pune is a good place… until you forget about the garmii. I feel bad for Pune wale — it's gonna be hotter now (cheesy right!)</p>

  <p>I just wanted to make you smile — you deserve to feel special every day. I’m sorry I did just this today. But today it’s a must that you feel special, right? Everyone must. So here’s me, being a little cheesy and doing something I wouldn’t do for just anyone — but for someone special.</p>

  <p>I'm literally having all the memories come flooding in (we don't have much, ik) but still. And lots of thoughts too, like you’ll be old enough someday to tell your grandkids:</p>
  <p><em>"Long long time ago, there lived a someone who was someone and..."</em> (I can't think of anything.)</p>

  <p>You remember this?</p>
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/SDLk9mSc/photo2.jpg" alt="Fun photo together" class="image" />

  <p>Yup. We did good shits together.</p>

  <p>You remember I drew you once?</p>
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/0VrfSY7w/photo1.jpg" alt="Sketch I drew of you" class="image" />

  <p>(I’m not good at it, but you’re perfect.)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    “Postcards to You”<br/>
    On stardust trails and skies so blue,<br/>
    I send my thoughts as postcards to you.<br/>
    A whisper of warmth, a dash of delight,<br/>
    Wrapped in wishes, glowing bright.<br/>
    Though miles stretch far and moments hide,<br/>
    Know I’m cheering from the other side.<br/>
    Happy Birthday, to the soul that shines<br/>
    You’re magic, in the simplest lines.
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    “From Me to the Mystery”<br/>
    You’re a spark I didn’t see coming,<br/>
    A notification that kept my heart humming.<br/>
    From random chats to secret smiles,<br/>
    You made the distance worth the miles.<br/>
    So here’s a wish wrapped soft and true,<br/>
    For the brightest day, just made for you.<br/>
    I might be far, but look around<br/>
    My care for you is all around.
  </div>

  <section id="future-you">
    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#d14a7c; font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif; margin-top: 40px;">A Glimpse into the Future</h2>
    <div style="text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/HDpzLnmx/IMG-4767.jpg" alt="Old Filter Fun" style="max-width: 250px; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top:10px;">Still the cutest notification — even in 2085!</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <p>In the end, I hope your day is full of good things, real laughs, and people who make you feel loved — even if one of them is just a guy sending you this from maybe 750 kilometres away.</p>

  <p>Happy Birthday.</p>

  <p class="signature">
    PS: IF YOU’RE READING THIS AGAIN AFTER A LONG TIME IN CASE YOU SAVED IT,<br/>
    HOW YOU DOIN OLD LADYY??!<br/>
    — a notification.
